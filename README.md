# Challenge_10_-Cryptocurrencies_Porfolio_Allocation_using_K-_Mean
For this challenge the objective was to create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurriencies by utilizing the K-Means and uses the Principal Composite Analysis (PCA) to find Cryptocurrencies that can be grouped together to form an optimal diversified Cryptocurrency portfolio. Please note, returns and volatility will also be used for the selection process.

## Technologies
The programming language used for this analysis was **Python (v 3.9.7)**.

The applicable libraries needed to run this analysis are:


`1. Path from pathlib 2. paandas 3. hvplot.pandas 4. sklearn (import KMeans,PCA & StandardScaler)`

---
## Installation Guide
Majority of the above libraries should be part of the base applications that were installed with the Python version above; if not, you will have to install them through the pip package manager of Python.
